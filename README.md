![Sprint demo project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82053164/126848913-790e0a6e-b477-49a7-b4c0-9e13eaef4683.png)

# Solution statement:

 Build a simple web app that shows the most recent jobs for software engineering jobs in the last 48 hours.

These are their key use-cases:

*As a job seeker, I can see the 10 most recent 
*As a job seeker, I can search for all jobs within the last 48 hours
*As a job seeker, I can change the date and it shows the last 48 hours from the date I choose (date format as in YYYY-MM-DD)
*As a job seeker, I can save a job
*If I save a job, it should show on my homepage (in addition to the most recent 10 jobs)

# Contribution to the solution:

I used Jira to track what I needed to do for the project, created my wireframe in adobe xd. I then created the app interface with tailwindcss.When a use enters an input and submits for a job result, the information/api is displayed. I created functionality with javascript: I used ayscn/await funcation to fecth the data, event listnters and dom manipulation to have the job search results to display in the html file.  I was able to use paramters that specify the location to Massachestts and the job title of Software engineering. I  created variables where I used to to display the objects in the jobposting.
